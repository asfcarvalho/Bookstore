This book shows you how to use the powerful cocos2d game engine to develop games for iPhone and iPad with tilemaps, virtual joypads, Game Center, and more. It teaches you: The process and best practices of mobile game development, including sprite batching, texture atlases, parallax scrolling, touch and accelerometer input. How to enhance your games using the Box2D and Chipmunk physics engines and other cocos2d-related tools and libraries. How to add UIKit views to cocos2d and how to add cocos2d to UIKit apps. The ins and outs of the Kobold2D development environment for cocos2d and its preconfigured libraries, including cocos3d and Lua. Best of all, Learn cocos2d Game Development with iOS 5 will have you making games right from the very start. It guides you step-by-step through the creation of sample games. These fun examples are modeled after popular App Store games and teach you key concepts of the cocos2d game engine and relevant tools like TexturePacker (texture atlas), PhysicsEditor (physics collision shapes), Particle Designer (particle effects), Glyph Designer (bitmap fonts), and others. This book offers a rock-solid introduction to creating games made entirely with cocos2d and little or no iOS 5 SDK and OpenGL code. It also details alternative implementations, identifies the best free and commercial tools for cocos2d game development, features coverage of the author's improved cocos2d game engine (Kobold2D), and even helps you enhance your game's marketability on the App Store.",

                "description": "Rise above the basics of Xcode app development to implement tools like Share buttons and activity view controllers to share document content including parts of documents with other users and with other devices. This book fills the gap so that developers with even a fundamental knowledge of iOS and Swift can implement document creation, saving, and sharing in their apps. Since the launch of iPhone in 2007, users and developers have struggled with the fact that the file system is hidden. Fortunately the Files app in iOS 11 now offers this feature and it is supported by Apple apps such as Numbers, Pages, and Keynote as well as by the few third-party apps that support documents. By using the standard formats described in this book, you can make your app’s data shareable to and from other apps like Numbers, Pages, and Word. Files also provides an interface to tools such as Dropbox and iCloud so that users can open and modify documents in them. If you combine standard formats such as .doc, .docx, .jpeg, and .jpg with Dropbox and eMail, you have a simple way to implement and use cross-platform sharing to Macs, PCs, and Android devices. Implementing iOS and macOS Documents with the Files App provides the combination of skills developers need to build these types of apps—working with files and constructing documents. What You'll Learn Add Document Support to Your Apps Share your documents with iCloud and Apple IDs across your Mac and iOS devices Use standard formats from .doc, .docx, .png, and .jpeg both for input and output Manage and organize documents Who This Book Is For Developers with a basic knowledge of app development and Swift. You should already know how to use Xcode to create an app. Knowledge of basic Swift syntax is recommended. The book can also be a useful overview and guide to managers who are trying to decide how to convert legacy document-based systems to apps.",

Beginning with the basics, this book outlines the steps to set up an iOS development environment, together with an introduction to using Swift Playgrounds to learn and experiment with Swift. The book also includes in-depth chapters introducing the Swift 5.7 programming language, including data types, control flow, functions, object-oriented programming, property wrappers, structured concurrency, and error handling. A guided tour of Xcode in SwiftUI development mode follows an introduction to the key concepts of SwiftUI and project architecture. The book also covers creating custom SwiftUI views and explains how these views are combined to create user interface layouts, including stacks, frames, and forms. Other topics covered include data handling using state properties and observable, state, and environment objects, as are key user interface design concepts such as modifiers, lists, tabbed views, context menus, user interface navigation, and outline groups. The book also covers graphics and chart drawing, user interface animation, view transitions and gesture handling, WidgetKit, document-based apps, Core Data, CloudKit, and SiriKit integration. Chapters also explain how to integrate SwiftUI views into existing UIKit-based projects and integrate UIKit code into SwiftUI. Finally, the book explains how to package up a completed app and upload it to the App Store for publication. Along the way, the topics covered in the book are put into practice through detailed tutorials, the source code for which is also available for download. The aim of this book, therefore, is to teach you the skills to build your own apps for iOS 16 using SwiftUI. Assuming you are ready to download the iOS 16 SDK and Xcode 14 and have an Apple Mac system, you are ready to get started.",
